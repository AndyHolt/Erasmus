TODOs:
  - check use of smallcaps LORD. May need to set explicitly in LaTeX
  - Greek text needs to be wrapped in babel environment
  - Add some unit tests
  - Does using unicode format make things easier? Would it work with XeTeX?
    
(less urgent):
  - more paratext options (include transation footnotes, even cross references)
  - option for bible database generation
      Each book has directory, each chapter a file and each verse a line.
      Useful for searching, word studies, statistical analysis etc
