TODOs:
  - check use of smallcaps LORD. May need to set explicitly in LaTeX
  - Greek text needs to be wrapped in babel environment
  - Add some unit tests
  - Does using unicode format make things easier? Would it work with XeTeX?
  - Add a header reference for pages
    (see Mark printout for a handwritten version)
    At top of each page, a reference marker showing which verses are on that
    page for easier reference and finding, especially among longer chapters.
    Chapter number in large format (a la the chapter numbers in text) and verse
    numbers smaller.
    Add a more subtle version for "reader" versions of polyglots, chapters and
    numbers in smaller text, perhaps greyed and in roman font, rather than
    sanserif.
  - Make multi-chapter selections work. May be best to use multiple requests and
    stitch together at LaTeX level? Or may be able to just get longer sections
    from Bible Gateway. ALIGNMENT WILL BE AN ISSUE! MAY NEED TO FIND A NEW WAY
    OF DOING THAT?
    
(less urgent):
  - more paratext options (include transation footnotes, even cross references)
  - option for bible database generation
      Each book has directory, each chapter a file and each verse a line.
      Useful for searching, word studies, statistical analysis etc
